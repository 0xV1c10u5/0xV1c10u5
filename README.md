# Bonsoir.

## Whoami
Hackerman.  Web, Web3, Mobile, AI.

## Why?
Moved all private repos to self-hosting pipeline to avoid data harvesting for AI training w/o consent.  


<p>
  
This account is **now** for learning/pet projects only.</p>

<p>

**(UPDATE)** I have since found git hosting for open-source repos that does not train AI on your IP @ [https://codeberg.org/](https://codeberg.org/)</p>

### Roadmap:
- Bounty Trophy Display
- **(Scripts)** Scaffolding/Bootstrapping Utility Automation
- **(Typescript)** AI Generated Blog w/GitHub Actions
- **(Python)** Div Growth Bot
- **(Elixir)** Core_X (Core SA-X Elixir Library, Calls Varia)
- **(Rust)** Varia (Hacking Library Called by Core_X, gRPC)
- **(Rust)** Modular Database
